# **Machine_learning_imdb**
**Building machine learning models based on the dataset of the 1000 best movies on imdb**

___The purpose of this project___ is to analyze a dataset that includes the 1000 best films according to the imdb website and build machine learning models to get ahead of variables that have a greater impact on the monetary gross of films, as well as to determine the predictive ability of models relative to film gross.

This dataset includes the following variables with their type:
+ Series Titles - categorical
+ Released Year - numeric
+ Certificate - categorical
+ Runtime - numeric
+ IMDB rating - numeric
+ Meta_score Rating - numeric
+ Number of those who voted - numeric
+ Directors - categorical
+ Actors (1,2,3,4 roles) - categorical
+ Gross - numeric

The program uses ***the following libraries*** for data processing:
+ Pandas
+ Numpy
+ Seaborn
+ Matplotlib

The main ***metrics*** of the model's effectiveness are: MAE and MSE
It is planned to use models to solve the problems of finding numerical values:
+ RandomForestRegression
+ DecisionTreeRegression
+ LinearRegression
+ e.t.c

The project is under implementation, the information is being updated
